\DISAbstract{%
  One of the current most effective treatments for brain tumor's is radiotherapy. However, this has the side-effect of damaging healthy cells with potentially severe consequences. Improvements in radiotherapy treatment such as proton therapy allow a more spatially localized treatment. However, the sensitivity of different cell types to radioactivity is not currently well modeled. We present a method for predicting the radio-sensitivity of a cell based on its genetic content using a biologically informed neural network. We compare the use of different data features for training this model, different network architecture and develop a procedure for transfer learning, where drug response data is incorporated into the model training. We compare the model performance using a cross-validation procedure ensuring unbiased performance estimates with faithful uncertainty estimates. We find the model is able to predict radio-sensitivity with $R^2=16\pm10$\%. We investigate an improvement to this model based on transfer learning, which shows promising results.
