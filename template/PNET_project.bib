abstract = {Copy number variants (CNVs) were the subject of extensive research in the past years. They are common features of the human genome that play an important role in evolution, contribute to population diversity, development of certain diseases, and influence host–microbiome interactions. CNVs have found application in the molecular diagnosis of many diseases and in non-invasive prenatal care, but their full potential is only emerging. CNVs are expected to have a tremendous impact on screening, diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring of several disorders, including cancer and cardiovascular disease. Here, we comprehensively review basic definitions of the term CNV, outline mechanisms and factors involved in CNV formation, and discuss their evolutionary and pathological aspects. We suggest a need for better defined distinguishing criteria and boundaries between known types of CNVs.}

Moreover, the biological interpretability within P-{NET} revealed established and novel molecularly altered candidates, such as {MDM}4 and {FGFR}1, which were implicated in predicting advanced disease and validated in vitro.

	abstract = {All living organisms are composed of cells, each no wider than a human hair. Each of our cells contains the same complement of {DNA} constituting the human genome (Figure 1-1.) The {DNA} sequence of every person's genome is the blueprint for his or her development from a single cell to a complex, integrated organism that is composed of more than 1013 (10 million million) cells. Encoded in the {DNA} sequence are fundamental determinants of those mental capacities—learning, language, memory—essential to human culture. Encoded there as well are the mutations and variations that cause or increase susceptibility to many diseases responsible for much human suffering. Unprecedented advances in molecular and cellular biology, in biochemistry, in genetics, and in structural biology—occurring at an accelerating rate over the past decade—define this as a unique and opportune moment in our history: For the first time we can envision obtaining easy access to the complete sequence of the 3 billion nucleotides in human {DNA} and deciphering much of the information contained therein. Converging developments in recombinant {DNA} technology and genetics make obtaining a complete ordered {DNA} clone collection indexed to the human genetic linkage map a realistic immediate goal. Even determination of the complete nucleotide sequence is attainable, although ambitious. The {DNA} in the human genome is remarkably stable, as it must be to provide a reliable blueprint for building a new organism. For this reason, obtaining complete genetic linkage and physical maps and deciphering the sequence will provide a permanent base of knowledge concerning all human beings—a base whose utility for all activities of biology and medicine will increase with future analysis, research, and experimentation.},

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.},

To assess the preclinical feasibility of drug sensitivity prediction, several studies have measured drug responses for cytotoxic and targeted therapies across large collections of genomically and transcriptomically characterized cancer cell lines and trained predictive models using standard methods like elastic net regression. Here we use existing drug response data sets to demonstrate that multitask learning across drugs strongly improves the accuracy and interpretability of drug prediction models. Our method uses trace norm regularization with a highly efficient {ADMM} (alternating direction method of multipliers) optimization algorithm that readily scales to large data sets.

	doi = {10.1158/0008-5472.CAN-19-0179},
	abstract = {Radiotherapy is integral to the care of a majority of patients with cancer. Despite differences in tumor responses to radiation (radioresponse), dose prescriptions are not currently tailored to individual patients. Recent large-scale cancer cell line databases hold the promise of unravelling the complex molecular arrangements underlying cellular response to radiation, which is critical for novel predictive biomarker discovery. Here, we present {RadioGx}, a computational platform for integrative analyses of radioresponse using radiogenomic databases. We fit the dose-response data within {RadioGx} to the linear-quadratic model. The imputed survival across a range of dose levels ({AUC}) was a robust radioresponse indicator that correlated with biological processes known to underpin the cellular response to radiation. Using {AUC} as a metric for further investigations, we found that radiation sensitivity was significantly associated with disruptive mutations in genes related to nonhomologous end joining. Next, by simulating the effects of different oxygen levels, we identified putative genes that may influence radioresponse specifically under hypoxic conditions. Furthermore, using transcriptomic data, we found evidence for tissue-specific determinants of radioresponse, suggesting that tumor type could influence the validity of putative predictive biomarkers of radioresponse. Finally, integrating radioresponse with drug response data, we found that drug classes impacting the cytoskeleton, {DNA} replication, and mitosis display similar therapeutic effects to ionizing radiation on cancer cell lines. In summary, {RadioGx} provides a unique computational toolbox for hypothesis generation to advance preclinical research for radiation oncology and precision medicine. {SIGNIFICANCE}: The {RadioGx} computational platform enables integrative analyses of cellular response to radiation with drug responses and genome-wide molecular data. {GRAPHICAL} {ABSTRACT}: http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/canres/79/24/6227/F1.large.jpg.See related commentary by Spratt and Speers, p. 6076.},

However, such data are scattered and lack standards for efﬁcient access and analysis, consequently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To address these issues, we implemented {PharmacoGx}, an easy-to-use, open source package for integrative analysis of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. We demonstrate the utility of our package in comparing large drug sensitivity datasets, such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Moreover, we show how to use our package to easily perform Connectivity Map analysis.

	abstract = {Summary: Pharmacogenomics holds great promise for the development of biomarkers of drug response and the design of new therapeutic options, which are key challenges in precision medicine. However, such data are scattered and lack standards for efficient access and analysis, consequently preventing the realization of the full potential of pharmacogenomics. To address these issues, we implemented {PharmacoGx}, an easy-to-use, open source package for integrative analysis of multiple pharmacogenomic datasets. We demonstrate the utility of our package in comparing large drug sensitivity datasets, such as the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Moreover, we show how to use our package to easily perform Connectivity Map analysis. With increasing availability of drug-related data, our package will open new avenues of research for meta-analysis of pharmacogenomic data.Availability and implementation: {PharmacoGx} is implemented in R and can be easily installed on any system. The package is available from {CRAN} and its source code is available from {GitHub}.Contact: bhaibeka@uhnresearch.ca or benjamin.haibe.kains@utoronto.{caSupplementary} information:  Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},
